## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

This is a portfolio website, a project given to me by my coach at HerTechTail. The project is based on building a profolio website from the template provided.

## The challenge

I faced a great challange when trying to understand the template provided to be able to build on it effectively. Bootstrap also gave me a bit of challange since this is my first project with bootstrap. I was able to overcome these challanges with the help of YouTube, discussion with some of my colleague and help form my accountability partners.
